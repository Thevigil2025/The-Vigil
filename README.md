# DustVigil

DustVigil is an innovative air pollution control project designed to address both outdoor and indoor dust pollution, specifically targeting construction sites. The project consists of two key devices:

 **A Drone for Outdoor Dust Control** - A flying robot, capable of sensing dust levels and spraying a water + plant-based additive solution to settle dust.
 **Application For Controlling the Drone and other features**  -
 DustVigil Software Application
The DustVigil Software Application is designed to monitor, control, and analyze dust pollution data collected from DustVigil devices. It provides real-time insights and allows users to interact with both the Drone .

Key Features
✅ Real-Time Dust Monitoring – Displays live dust levels from sensors on a dashboard.
✅ Drone Control Panel – Allows users to operate the drone manually or set it to autonomous mode.
✅ Data Analytics & Reports – Provides dust level trends and patterns over time.
✅ GPS Tracking – Shows drone movement and dust concentration zones.
✅ Battery & Resource Monitoring – Displays battery life and refill alerts for both devices.

## Features
- **Drone for Outdoor Pollution Control**
  - Senses dust levels in real time
  - Sprays a water-based solution to minimize dust
  - Designed for automated and manual operation
  - Can be recharged and refilled at a central station

Technologies Used
- **Hardware:** Sensors, microcontrollers, motors, battery systems
- **Software:** Android Studio (using Kotlin)
