# DustVigil

DustVigil is an innovative air pollution control project designed to address both outdoor and indoor dust pollution, specifically targeting construction sites. The project consists of two key devices:

1. **A Drone for Outdoor Dust Control** - A flying robot designed like a pigeon, capable of sensing dust levels and spraying a water + plant-based additive solution to settle dust.
2. **A Hand-Held Vacuum Device for Indoor Dust Control** - A portable device that can be mounted on tools like drills, equipped with sensors to measure dust accumulation and display data on a mobile/web application.

## Features
- **Drone for Outdoor Pollution Control**
  - Senses dust levels in real time
  - Sprays a water-based solution to minimize dust
  - Designed for automated and manual operation
  - Can be recharged and refilled at a central station
  
- **Hand-Held Vacuum for Indoor Pollution Control**
  - Collects dust generated during drilling and surface smoothing
  - Mountable on tools to reduce worker exposure to airborne particles
  - Includes a sensor to track dust accumulation
  - Displays real-time data on a mobile/web app

Technologies Used
- **Hardware:** Sensors, microcontrollers, motors, battery systems
- **Software:** Python (Flask for backend), MySQL (database), Mobile/Web application for monitoring
- **AI Integration:** Dust level sensing and automated spray control
